# SDLC AI Context Store - Architecture Proposal

## 📋 Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the design and implementation strategy for building a **comprehensive Context Store for an SDLC AI Platform**. The system aggregates context information from various enterprise data sources, processes them through a robust data pipeline, and stores them in optimized storage layers (vector database and document store) to enable advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities for code generation and SDLC automation.

### Key Objectives

- **Unified Context Management**: Aggregate data from 10+ enterprise SDLC data sources
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Enable semantic search and context-aware information retrieval
- **Real-Time Processing**: Stream data changes with minimal latency
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle enterprise-scale data volumes and query loads
- **Multi-Modal Storage**: Optimize storage based on data characteristics and access patterns

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

- **Scattered Context**: SDLC information dispersed across multiple disconnected systems
- **Manual Context Gathering**: Developers spend significant time searching for relevant information
- **Stale Information**: Lack of real-time synchronization leads to outdated context
- **Inefficient Code Generation**: AI systems lack comprehensive organizational context
- **Knowledge Silos**: Team knowledge trapped in individual tools and systems
- **Poor AI Accuracy**: Limited context results in generic, less useful AI-generated outputs

### Business Impact

- **Developer Productivity Loss**: 30-40% of developer time spent on information gathering
- **Inconsistent AI Outputs**: Low-quality code generation due to missing context
- **Onboarding Delays**: New team members struggle to understand project context
- **Technical Debt**: Lack of historical context leads to repeated mistakes
- **Compliance Risks**: Incomplete audit trails and change tracking

### Architecture Principles

1. **Event-Driven**: Real-time data synchronization using CDC and webhooks
2. **Decoupled Components**: Microservices architecture for independent scaling
3. **Idempotent Processing**: Safe retry mechanisms for data pipeline
4. **Multi-Tenant**: Support for multiple organizations and projects
5. **Security First**: End-to-end encryption, RBAC, and audit logging
6. **Graph-Native**: Knowledge graph at the core for connected experiences
7. **Context Fabric**: Unified layer integrating vector, document, and graph stores

## 🔧 Detailed Component Architecture

### 1. Data Sources Layer

#### Source Categories & Characteristics

| Data Source | Usecase | Type | Update Frequency | Data Volume | Access Method |
|-------------|---------|------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Application Portfolio** | Application Discovery | Structured | Daily | Medium | REST API |
| **ALM Systems** | Application Lifecycle Management | Structured | Hourly | Medium | REST API / CDC |
| **Team Registry** | Team Management | Structured | Weekly | Low | REST API |
| **Org Hierarchy** | Organizational Structure | Structured | Monthly | Low | REST API |
| **Jira/Project Mgmt** | Project Tracking | Semi-Structured | Real-time | High | Webhook + REST API |
| **GitHub/GitLab** | Code Repository | Structured + Unstructured | Real-time | Very High | Webhook + GraphQL |
| **Confluence/Docs** | Documentation | Unstructured | Hourly | High | REST API |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Continuous Integration | Time-Series | Real-time | High | Webhook + API |
| **DevSecOps Tools** | Security Scanning | Structured | Real-time | Medium | API / Webhook |
| **Test Automation** | Automated Testing | Structured | Per Build | High | API |
| **Release Management** | Release Orchestration | Structured | Daily | Medium | API |
| **Change Management** | Change Tracking | Structured | Daily | Medium | API |
| **Observability** | Application Monitoring | Real-time | Very High | Metrics | API |
| **Incident Management** | Incident Tracking | Structured | Real-time | Medium | Webhook + API |
| **Infrastructure** | Cloud/Infra Context | Structured | Daily | Medium | API |
| **Application Dependency Mapping** | Dependency Analysis | Structured | Weekly | Medium | API |

### 2. Data Ingestion Architecture

**High-Level Flow**: Data from 13+ SDLC sources flows through ingestion connectors into Apache Kafka, which acts as the event backbone. Apache Beam pipelines (running on Apache Flink runtime) consume events from Kafka, process them through 6 stages (validation, transformation, quality checks, chunking, embedding, storage), and write to the tri-store (Milvus + MongoDB + Neo4j).

**Ingestion Layer Components:**

![diagram: Data Ingestion Architecture](./docs/image_dataflow.png)

**What Happens Here:**

1. **Source Systems** → Various SDLC tools (Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Jenkins, etc.)
2. **Ingestion Connectors** → Capture data via webhooks (real-time), CDC (database changes), REST APIs (polling), or event streams
3. **Apache Kafka** → Buffers events in partitioned topics, provides backpressure handling and replay capability
4. **Schema Registry** → Validates data schemas using Avro, ensures data consistency
5. **Next Stage** → Events flow to Apache Beam pipeline on Flink (detailed below) →

### 3. Why Apache Beam + Flink?

**Apache Beam Benefits:**

- Unified batch and streaming model
- Portable across multiple runners (Flink, Spark, Dataflow)
- Rich windowing and state management
- Built-in data quality and monitoring

**Apache Flink as Runner:**

- True streaming with low latency (< 100ms)
- Exactly-once processing semantics
- Advanced state management
- High throughput and scalability

**Alternative Considerations:**

- **Apache Spark Structured Streaming**: Good for batch-heavy workloads, but higher latency
- **Apache Kafka Streams**: Simpler but less portable and limited to Kafka
- **Recommendation**: Stick with **Apache Beam + Flink** for best balance of features and performance
