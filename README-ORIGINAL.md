## 🎯 Project Overview

Design and develop a unified, cross-platform, end-to-end (E2E) installer for deploying and managing a Kubernetes-based application across startup, mid-size, enterprise, and air-gapped environments.
The installer automates provisioning, configuration, deployment, validation, and lifecycle management across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises (OpenShift, Rancher, etc.) infrastructures while ensuring compliance, security, and resilience.

This installer provides a unified approach to Kubernetes cluster deployment with:

- **CLI-First Design**: Built with Go and Cobra framework for robust command-line operations
- **Multi-Cloud Native**: Seamless deployment across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises
- **Security-First**: Integrated security scanning, RBAC, and policy enforcement
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade monitoring, logging, and operational tools
- **Validation-Driven**: Comprehensive pre-flight and post-deployment validation

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- **Simplify Deployment**: Streamline application deployment and lifecycle management in Kubernetes clusters
- **Air-gapped Support**: Provide offline installation and upgrade capabilities for secure environments
- **Compliance & Auditability**: Ensure compliance, auditability, idempotency, and cross-cloud portability
- **Flexible Installation**: Offer both interactive and non-interactive (config-driven) installation modes
- **Self-contained Delivery**: Enable complete deployment without direct vendor package access

## 📋 Scope and Functional Requirements

### Artifact preparation & shipping into the client environment

- **Container Images (OCI)**: Transfer from vendor registries → client's private registry (or verify presence if client already mirrors). GitHub Packages, DockerHub, Azure ACR, AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry supported as source registries and Harbor, Nexus, JFrog Artifactory as destination registries
- **Helm Charts**: Migration from vendor GitHub → client GitHub (or maintain local checkout if mirroring is disabled). The charts are versioned and tagged in the vendor GitHub repo
- **Terraform Modules**: Transfer from vendor GitHub → client GitHub (or maintain local checkout), versioned and tagged in the vendor GitHub repo
- **Database Migration & Repair Scripts**: Transfer from vendor GitHub → client GitHub (or maintain local checkout), versioned and tagged in the vendor GitHub repo
- **Health Checks & Validation**: Ensure all artifacts are verified, scanned, and ready for deployment with detailed reporting

### Full E2E installation once artifacts are in client environment

- ✅ **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform-based deployment (K8s clusters, managed DBs/services)
- ✅ **Database Migrations**: Flyway/Liquibase execution as Kubernetes Job/init container
- ✅ **Application Deployment**: Helm-based deployment in configured order with pod readiness + health URL checks
- ✅ **Post-validation**: Comprehensive checks, housekeeping, and E2E smoke tests

### 🎮 Operation modes

- 🎯 **Interactive & Config-driven Modes**: Guided configuration with user prompts or fully automated using configuration files
- 🎯 **Idempotent Operations**: All steps are resume-safe and can be re-run with structured output and progress bars
- 🎯 **Environment Support**: Both air-gapped and connected environments supported

### Once artifacts are in the client environment (E2E install flow)

### 1. `set-up`

**Purpose**: Initialize workspace and validate prerequisites
**Actions**:

- Validate environment (OS, CLI tools, network access)

### 2. `package-pull`

**Purpose**: Pull/mirror OCI images, Helm charts, and Terraform modules
**Actions**:

- Execute the shipping model above for images, Helm, Terraform
- Produce package-pull-report.json (digests, refs, scan/signature results, mirroring outcome)
- Show progress bars per artifact; ensure idempotency (skip unchanged)

### 3. `provision-infra`

**Purpose**: Provision Kubernetes cluster and managed services (idempotent)
**Actions**:

- Uses client-side Terraform (mirrored or local) to create K8s clusters, networks, managed DBs/queues/storage per config
- Runs embedded health checks (module scripts)
- Produces infra-report.json with outputs (e.g., kube API endpoint, credentials, namespaces)

### 4. `db-migrate`

**Purpose**: Migrate database schema and data
**Actions**:

- Fetches DB scripts from vendor GitHub tag; mirrors to client GitHub if configured or uses local checkout
- Runs as K8s Job/init container (Flyway/Liquibase) in the target namespace
- Streams logs to console; writes db-migrate-report.json (applied versions, validation)

### 5. `deploy`

**Purpose**: Deploy application components
**Actions**:

- Applies Helm releases in configured order (namespaces, values)
- Waits for pod readiness; probes health URLs where defined
- Writes deploy-report.json with per-component status and timings

### 6. `post-validate`

**Purpose**: Execute post-deployment validation and housekeeping
**Actions**:

- Executes post scripts (housekeeping: log rotation, backup/restore hooks, config sync)
- Writes post-validate-report.json

### 7. `e2e-test`

**Purpose**: Run smoke/E2E checks
**Actions**:

- Runs smoke/E2E checks; writes e2e-report.json

### 8. `install (orchestrator)`

**Purpose**: Orchestrate the full installation workflow
**Actions**:

- Chains the steps: package-pull → provision-infra → db-migrate → deploy → post-validate → e2e-test
- Resume from failure (--from-step), limit to a stage (--to-step)
- Produces a consolidated install-summary.json (links to all reports, final status)

### 9. `healthy-check`

**Purpose**: Perform comprehensive health checks on the deployed environment
**Actions**:

- Executes a series of health checks to validate the state of the deployed services and infrastructure

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Provisioning

- **Terraform Integration**: Use Terraform for cloud and cluster provisioning
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Support Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-prem (OpenShift, Rancher) Kubernetes setups

### Multi-Mode Infrastructure Provisioning System

The **Infrastructure Manager** (`pkg/infrastructure/manager.go`) provides a unified interface supporting three distinct provisioning modes:

#### **1. Terraform Mode** 🏗️

- **Purpose**: Pure Terraform-based infrastructure provisioning
- **Use Case**: Cloud-native deployments with Terraform state management
- **Components**:
  - `pkg/terraform/manager.go`: Terraform operations (init, plan, apply)
  - Multi-cloud support (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE)
  - Automated health checks and validation

#### **2. Makefile Mode** ⚙️

- **Purpose**: Makefile-based infrastructure workflows
- **Use Case**: Custom provisioning scripts, legacy systems, hybrid environments
- **Components**:
  - `pkg/makefile/manager.go`: Makefile execution with enterprise features
  - Target execution with timeout and environment management
  - Integration with existing DevOps workflows

#### **3. Hybrid Mode** 🔄

- **Purpose**: Combined Terraform + Makefile workflows
- **Use Case**: Complex environments requiring both approaches
- **Workflow**: Makefile orchestration calling Terraform modules internally

```go
// Infrastructure Manager modes
const (
    ProvisionModeTerraform = "terraform"  // Pure Terraform
    ProvisionModeMakefile  = "makefile"   // Pure Makefile  
    ProvisionModeHybrid    = "hybrid"     // Combined approach
)
```

### Unified Infrastructure Interface

```go
type Manager struct {
    config          *config.InfrastructureConfig
    terraformMgr    *terraform.Manager      // Terraform operations
    makefileMgr     *makefile.Manager       // Makefile execution
    provisionMode   string                  // Mode selector
}

// Unified operations across all modes
func (m *Manager) Init(dryRun bool) error
func (m *Manager) Plan(dryRun bool) error  
func (m *Manager) Apply(dryRun bool) error
func (m *Manager) Destroy(dryRun bool) error
func (m *Manager) Validate(dryRun bool) error
```

      "backend": {
        "type": "s3",
        "config": {
          "bucket": "my-terraform-state",
          "key": "k8s-installer/terraform.tfstate",
          "region": "us-west-2"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Makefile Mode Configuration**

```json
{
  "infrastructure": {
    "provisionMode": "makefile",
    "makefile": {
      "enabled": true,
      "makefilePath": "./Makefile",
      "workingDirectory": "./infrastructure",
      "targets": ["init", "plan", "apply", "destroy"],
      "timeout": "30m",
      "env": {
        "AWS_REGION": "us-west-2",
        "TF_VAR_cluster_name": "my-k8s-cluster"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Hybrid Mode Configuration**

```json
{
  "infrastructure": {
    "provisionMode": "hybrid",
    "provider": "aws",
    "region": "us-west-2",
    "terraform": {
      "enabled": true,
      "workingDir": "./terraform",
      "varsFile": "terraform.tfvars"
    },
    "makefile": {
      "enabled": true,
      "makefilePath": "./Makefile",

}
```

### Configuration Validation

The configuration system includes comprehensive validation:

- **Required Fields**: Validates all mandatory configuration fields
- **Format Validation**: Ensures URLs, durations, and other formats are correct
- **File Existence**: Validates file paths and directories exist
- **Semantic Validation**: Cross-field validation for logical consistency

### Generating Configuration

```bash
# Generate sample configuration with set-up command
./e2e-k8s-installer set-up --workspace ./my-project --config-file my-config.json

# This creates a workspace with:
# - Directory structure
# - Sample installer-config.json file
# - README with usage instructions
```

## 🎮 Usage Guide

## 🔒 Security Features

### Current Security Implementation

The installer currently implements enterprise-grade security patterns:

#### **Input Validation & Configuration Security** ✅

```json
{
  "installer": {
    "logLevel": "info",        // Validated enum: debug, info, warn, error
    "workspace": "./workspace", // Path validation and sanitization
    "dryRun": false            // Boolean validation
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "images": {
      "vendor": {
        "registry": "https://vendor-registry.io", // URL validation
        "auth": {
          "token": "***"                          // Secure credential handling
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Current Security Features:**

- **Configuration Validation**: Comprehensive input validation using go-playground/validator
- **Credential Security**: Secure handling of registry credentials and tokens
- **Path Sanitization**: Safe file system operations with proper path validation
- **Network Security**: TLS-enabled communications with all external registries
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail using structured logging (zerolog)

#### **Planned Security Framework** 🔄

The following security features are planned for future releases:

##### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

```yaml
# Future implementation
security:
  rbac:
    enabled: true
    custom_roles:
      - name: "developer"
        rules:
          - apiGroups: ["apps"]
            resources: ["deployments"]
            verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update"]
```

##### Network Policies

```yaml
# Future implementation
security:
  network_policies:
    enabled: true
    default_deny: true
    policies:
      - name: "allow-ingress"
        spec:
          podSelector: {}
          policyTypes: ["Ingress"]
```

##### Security Scanning

- **Container Scanning**: Trivy integration for vulnerability detection (planned)
- **Runtime Security**: Falco for runtime threat detection (planned)
- **Policy Enforcement**: OPA Gatekeeper for admission control (planned)
- **Compliance**: CIS Kubernetes Benchmark validation (planned)

### Current Security Best Practices

1. **Secure Configuration**: JSON-based configuration with comprehensive validation
2. **Credential Management**: Secure token and password handling
3. **Network Security**: TLS-only communications with external services

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Support

### Current Command Debugging

#### Debug Mode for Current Commands

```bash
# Enable verbose logging for set-up command
./e2e-k8s-installer set-up --workspace ./test --verbose

# Enable verbose logging for package-pull command  
./e2e-k8s-installer package-pull --config config.json --verbose

# Dry run mode (see what would be done without executing)
./e2e-k8s-installer set-up --workspace ./test --dry-run
./e2e-k8s-installer package-pull --config config.json --dry-run

# Check command help
./e2e-k8s-installer set-up --help
./e2e-k8s-installer package-pull --help
```

### Common Issues & Solutions (Current Implementation)

#### Issue: set-up Command Prerequisites Failed

```bash
# Check if required tools are installed
which kubectl
which helm  
which terraform

# Install missing prerequisites:
# kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl"

# helm
brew install helm

# terraform  
brew install terraform
```

**Solution**: Ensure kubectl, helm, and terraform are installed and available in PATH.

#### Issue: package-pull Registry Authentication Failures

```bash
# Test registry connectivity
curl -v https://your-registry.io/v2/

# Verify authentication credentials in config
cat installer-config.json | grep -A5 "auth"

# Test Docker login (if using Docker-compatible registry)
echo "your-password" | docker login your-registry.io -u your-username --password-stdin
```

**Solution**: Verify registry URLs, credentials, and network connectivity.

#### Issue: Configuration File Validation Errors

```bash
# Validate JSON syntax
jq . installer-config.json

# Check for required fields
./e2e-k8s-installer package-pull --config installer-config.json --dry-run
```

**Common validation errors:**

- Invalid JSON syntax
- Missing required fields (`installer.workspace`, `artifacts.images.vendor.registry`)
- Invalid URL formats in registry configurations
- Missing authentication credentials

#### Issue: Workspace Permission Problems

```bash
# Check workspace directory permissions
ls -la ./workspace-directory/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 ./workspace-directory/
chown $USER:$USER ./workspace-directory/
```

**Solution**: Ensure the installer has read/write permissions to the workspace directory.

#### Issue: Git Repository Access Problems

```bash
# Test Git repository access
git clone https://github.com/vendor/helm-charts.git

# Check SSH key setup (for SSH URLs)
ssh -T git@github.com

# Verify Git credentials
git config --list | grep user
```

**Solution**: Ensure Git credentials are properly configured for repository access.

### Planned Troubleshooting Features 🔄

Future releases will include:

#### Issue: Cloud Authentication Failures

```bash
# AWS (planned)
aws configure list
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Azure (planned)
az account show
az ad signed-in-user show

# GCP (planned)
gcloud auth list
gcloud config list
```

#### Issue: Network Connectivity Problems

```bash
# Test connectivity (planned)
k8s-installer validate network

# Check DNS resolution (planned)
nslookup kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local

# Verify firewall rules (planned)
kubectl get networkpolicies --all-namespaces
```

#### Issue: Resource Quota Exceeded

```bash
# Check resource usage (planned)
kubectl describe nodes
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces

# Check quotas (planned)
kubectl describe quota --all-namespaces
```

### Support Bundle Collection (Planned)

```bash
# Generate comprehensive support bundle (planned)
e2e-k8s-installer support-bundle \
  --output support-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz \
  --include-logs \
  --include-config \
  --include-cluster-info
```

### Getting Help

For current implementation issues:

1. **Check Command Help**: Use `--help` flag for any command
2. **Enable Verbose Logging**: Use `--verbose` flag for detailed output
3. **Use Dry Run**: Test with `--dry-run` before actual execution
4. **Validate Configuration**: Ensure JSON syntax and required fields
5. **Check Prerequisites**: Verify kubectl, helm, terraform installation

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
